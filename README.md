The primary goal of this repo is to hold all the various projects I build in my free time. I'm hoping to grow in my software development skills. There's a lot to learn! So hopefully this repo will grow to hold many, many projects.

## List of Completed Projects
- TwitterStream: Ingest and Process Tweets into formats suitable for S3 and DynamoDB

## List of Upcoming Projects
- MangaTracker: Create a system on AWS that scrapes TenManga and ReadKingdom for new updates to manga I want to track. Set up continuous integration on MangaTracker in GitHub. The system should eventually integrate into a habit system as a reward - completion of a habit will unlock a chapter.
