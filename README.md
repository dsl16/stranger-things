The primary goal of this repo is to hold all the various projects I build in my free time. I'm hoping to grow in my software engineering skills. There's a lot to learn! So hopefully this repo will grow to hold many, many projects.

## Why Software Engineering?
I think I'm starting to acknowledge that I'm really more of an engineer than anything else. I like to solve problems by building solutions. That's different than medicine - where your focus is on treatment and using the most up-to-date solution - which has been a distracting path of potential for a long time. I'm still thinking through this choice (after all, once you have an MD, you have it for life), but for now, I certainly won't regret working on projects like these.
The most difficult part of software engineering for me is the fact that there is no formalized path. Everyone likes certainties, and I was definitely raised on the idea that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It was phrased as "become a doctor", but that's the core idea. If I could find a more reliable path through the world of software engineering, I would probably love to follow it. But that's for another time!

## List of Completed Projects
- OH Anomaly Detection: Detect anomalies in Outcome Health processes and alert users via Slack
- TwitterStream: Ingest and Process Tweets into formats suitable for S3 and DynamoDB

## List of Upcoming Projects
- MangaTracker: Create a system on AWS that scrapes TenManga and ReadKingdom for new updates to manga I want to track. Set up continuous integration on MangaTracker in GitHub. The system should eventually integrate into a habit system as a reward - completion of a habit will unlock a chapter.
- AWS Big Data Certification: I'm working towards my AWS Big Data Certification, and in the process, I'm certain I'll be building projects to solidify my understanding of the concepts and tools tested. Look forward to seeing a series of mini-projects!
