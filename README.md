The primary goal of this repo is to hold all the various projects I build in my free time. I'm hoping to grow in my software engineering skills. There's a lot to learn! So hopefully this repo will grow to hold many, many projects.

## Why Software Engineering?
I think I'm starting to acknowledge that I'm really more of an engineer than anything else. I like to solve problems by building solutions. That's different than medicine - where your focus is on treatment and using the most up-to-date solution - which has been a distracting path of potential for a long time. I'm still thinking through this choice (after all, once you have an MD, you have it for life), but for now, I certainly won't regret working on projects like these.

The most difficult part of software engineering for me is the fact that there is no formalized path. Everyone likes certainties, and I was definitely raised on the idea that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It was phrased as "become a doctor", but that's the core idea. If I could find a more reliable path through the world of software engineering, I would probably love to follow it. I'm looking through [resources like 80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) - if you're interested, you should, too!

## List of Completed Projects
- __OH Anomaly Detection__: Detect anomalies in Outcome Health processes and alert users via Slack
- __TwitterStream__: Ingest and Process Tweets into formats suitable for S3 and DynamoDB

## List of Current Projects
* __MangaTracker__: Create a system on AWS that scrapes TenManga and ReadKingdom for new updates to manga I want to track. Set up continuous integration on MangaTracker in GitHub. The system should eventually integrate into a habit system as a reward - completion of a habit will unlock a chapter.
  * [MangaTracker Statement of Purpose](https://www.notion.so/darrinlim/MangaTracker-Statement-of-Purpose-ef04731e4a564369a0a8ed6190aa88c3)
  * [MangaTracker Specification of Architecture](https://www.notion.so/darrinlim/MangaTracker-Specification-of-Architecture-6423a17c8cad4cfbbf55d0004977a1dd)
  * [MangaTracker Execution Checklist](https://www.notion.so/darrinlim/MangaTracker-Execution-Checklist-3e1fcb5f30414cf594f20b6f7a79b12c)
- __AWS Big Data Certification__: I'm working towards my AWS Big Data Certification, and in the process, I'm certain I'll be building projects to solidify my understanding of the concepts and tools tested. You can [follow along with my learning here](https://medium.com/series/f88281813b12). Look forward to seeing a series of mini-projects!
