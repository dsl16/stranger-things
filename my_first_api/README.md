# My First API
A project straight from ACloudGuru's ACG Projects.
Link can be found here: https://acloud.guru/series/acg-projects/view/109

This project will walk me through building my first API on AWS.

## What I hope to get out of the project
My main goal here is to learn the fundamentals of building an API. Because APIs are such a critical part of software development, learning how to design, build, and maintain one is important. Hopefully, by walking through how to make one here, I will have the know-how to build my own in the future.
