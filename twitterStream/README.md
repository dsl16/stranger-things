# twitterStream
A project straight from ACloudGuru's ACG-Projects.

Pulls in tweets related to cats, scores their sentiment, then saves a count of the sentiments to a DynamoDB table.

Uses AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and Kinesis to ingest, save, process, analyze, and save the results of analysis on Twitter tweets about a given subject.
