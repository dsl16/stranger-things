1) The original files in the test_project folder were the bin, docs, funmodule, and tests folders, and the setup.py file.
2) After running the setup.py file with the command "python setup.py install", the build, dist, and Fun_Module.egg-info folders were created.
3) You can go into the dist folder to find the .egg file.
4) Running an easy_install with the "easy_install {.egg file}" command installs the module into Anaconda.
5) From there you can import it at will!
